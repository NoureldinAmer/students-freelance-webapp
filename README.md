Welcome to [studentsfreelance.tech](http://studentsfreelance.tech/)! Students Freelance webapp is a combination of a frontend built with ReactJS and a backend built with NodeJS. In order to run the app, you will need to have both the frontend and the backend running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the app, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js: You can download the latest version of Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

- npm: npm is a package manager for Node.js and is included with the Node.js installation.

## Running the Frontend

To run the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory in your terminal:
`cd frontend`
2. Install the dependencies for the frontend by running the following command:
